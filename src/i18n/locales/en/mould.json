    "questions": {
      "spareParts": {
        "question": "Can you create spare parts for discontinued products?",
        "answer": "Yes, we specialize in producing spare parts for products that are no longer manufactured or where original replacements are prohibitively expensive. Using our advanced SLA printing and casting techniques, we can recreate parts with high precision from samples, technical drawings, or even create new designs based on your specifications."
      },
      "slaComparison": {
        "question": "How does SLA printing compare to traditional metallic molds?",
        "answer": "SLA printing offers faster turnaround times and lower costs for small to medium production runs. While traditional metallic molds are better for mass production, our SLA technology provides exceptional detail and precision without the high upfront tooling costs."
      },
      "productionTime": {
        "question": "How long does the production process take?",
        "answer": "The timeline depends on project complexity. Simple parts can be completed in 1-2 days, while complex projects may take 1 week. SLA printing significantly reduces lead times compared to traditional methods, allowing for rapid iterations and faster time-to-market."
      },
      "limitations": {
        "question": "What are the limitations of SLA printing for parts?",
        "answer": "While SLA printing offers exceptional detail and quality, it has limitations in terms of material properties and production volume. We'll help you determine if SLA is right for your project or if alternative methods would be more suitable based on your specific requirements and goals."
