        "category": "Manufacturing",
        "content": "In today's manufacturing landscape, there's often a challenging gap between one-off prototyping and full-scale mass production. At our FABLAB, we recently tackled this exact problem for a client who needed a specialized component in quantities that made traditional injection molding impractical. This blog post explores how we leveraged SLA printing technology to deliver a cost-effective small-batch production solution with remarkable efficiency.",
